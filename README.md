# sportsbookArbitrage

This program is intended to scrape data from Draftkings and Fanduel, match the games from both platforms, and identify mismatches in wager odds that present an opportunity for guaranteed profit. While there are many online resources that provide arbitrage calculations for a given matchup, these platforms have dozens of games at any one time, and sifting through them to consistently find arbitrage opportunities is impractical.
